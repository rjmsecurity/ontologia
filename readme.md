Don't repeat notes for certs or classes with overlapping material. Don't make a giant folder with subfolders for each one of your certs. Don't make a giant file that weighs a ton for each cert either. 

Instead, put a thousand bite-sized concepts in [/Concepts](Concepts/). Link to those concepts from the objectives for each cert. See the recurrence of certain concepts, their relationships, their structure. Reuse. Link. Minimize. 

I have six ways to organize these concepts so far. Six organizations. Frameworks.
