# Local user permissions

- Folder/file access for installation 
- installation programs need permission to write to the file system, which users typically won't have so a sysadmin is required to provide the credentials
- remember users wouldn't have these permissions to prevent somebody from accidentally installing malware
- a few install programs need to install their own services or drivers and so they need to run as Administrator, make sure you know what you're doing
