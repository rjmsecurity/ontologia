> 1.7 Summarize application installation and configuration concepts. 

# App install requirements

#### System requirements 

- not every computer can run every application
- Drive space – apps like video editors require hundreds of gigs because you're storing not only the apps but the content you create
- RAM – you need enough to run your OS *and* all the apps you want to execute at the same time

#### OS requirements and compatibility 

- many apps are written for a specific edition/type of OS
- some are written for 64-bit Windows, some for 32-bit Windows
- an app written for Windows 10 may not work properly on Windows 7
