# Network shares

- to see the shares on your computer, go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management
- from there on the left sidebar click on System Tools > Shared Folders > Shares
- in the main panel are the share name, folder path, and # client connections (how many people are currently connected to the share) columns
- shares let you connect to a folder on someone else's computer or vice versa
- this is achieved in Explorer where you assign/map a drive letter to a remote share
- you can also choose to automatically reconnect the share every time you start your computer
- if you name a share with a $ (dollar sign) at the end of the name, that share becomes hidden
- this just means it won't be listed to other people on the network; someone who knows the name can still connect 
- so it's an organizational feature, not a security feature

the objectives also have a bullet point on *administrative shares*, these are created by the system with a dollar sign at the end of their names so maybe it refers to hidden shares
