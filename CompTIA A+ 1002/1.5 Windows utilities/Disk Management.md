# Disk Management 

- this utility is for managing anything to do with the disks on individual computers and file servers
- Computer Management > Storage > Disk Management
- warning: data can be erased, so know what you're doing in this utility
- Drive status 
	- in the utility, each disk has a: 
		- volume name: *Windows 10*
		- drive letter if one is assigned: *C:*
		- drive size: *40.00 GB*
		- type of file system on the drive: *NTFS*
		- status: *Healthy*
	- *Healthy (At Risk)* status means it's functioning but has experienced input/output errors, so it's possible that drive could be failing
	- *Initializing* is another status and it's normal when you're working with a new drive
	- *Failed* is a status that shows when the drive cannot be started
	- if that's the case the disk is damaged or the file system is corrupted
	- *Failed Redundancy* shows when you have a RAID 1 or RAID 5 array and a disk has failed
	- if that case you need to replace the bad drive
	- *Resynching* is when you have a mirrored (RAID 1) array and you have a new drive and all the info needs to be copied to it
	- *Regenerating* is when you have RAID 5 and the data isn't simply being copied but being recreated or rebuilt based on the parity that's now missing on that bad drive
- Mounting 
	- fact: you are always running out of space on your computer
	- mounting is one way to extend space
	- instead of a new drive looking like a completely separate drive, to the user it looks just like a folder in the existing drive structure
	- mounting is the alternative to creating a separate drive and creating a separate share from that drive
	- Disk Management > right click the new volume > Change drive letter and paths > Add > Mount in empty NTFS folder > browse 
	- you can select a folder in your file system such as an empty Documents folder 
	- so you *mount* a drive into a folder
- Initializing: see the drive statuses above
- Extending partitions 
	- opposite of shrinking described below, you right click a volume on a drive and select extend volume
	- the new disk will be preselected
	- just type the amount of space you want to add, say 20 GB (20000 MB)
- Splitting partitions 
- Shrink partitions 
	- you need additional drive space for something different than what you originally planned
	- maybe you really only need 60 GB instead of 120 GB
	- right click on the 120 GB volume and select shrink partition
	- if you have some data written in there then the available shrink space will be smaller, it'll say in the dialog box
- Assigning/changing drive letters
