# Task Manager 

- it's basically Activity Monitor
- detailed information about CPU, memory, disk access
- *Ctrl-Alt-Delete* -> select Task Manager
- or right click task bar -> select Task Manager
- or just *Ctrl-Shift-Esc*
- 8/8.1/10 have number of enhancements over 7
- the Applications tab lists running apps
	- stop a running app or launch a new app from the File menu
	- combined with Processes tab in 8-10
- the Processes tab lists all running processes, which are interactive or *system tray* apps (the ones on the right side of the taskbar)
	- checkbox on bottom to show processes from all users, not just yours
	- you can remove and add columns/metrics
	- in my Windows, you can sort by a column by clicking the *CPU* or *Memory* at the top
	- so you can easily find the process using the most amount of that resource depending on what you're troubleshooting 
- the Services is also combined with the above two into a single Processes tab in 8-10 and it lists, you guessed it, services
- remember, a process is an instance of a particular executable (.exe) running and a service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop
- the Performance tab shows CPU usage history, memory usage history, etc. over the last few minutes
	- not designed to replace performance monitor 
	- in 8-10 you have additional metrics like disk utilization and network utilization (which is its own tab in Windows 7, described below)
	- so this gives you a better idea of trends with resource use over more than just a second in time
- the Networking tab shows connection speeds for each individual network connection and link speeds for different interfaces on your computer
	- this is a tab in Windows 7 and a sub-tab of the Performance tab in 8-10
- the Users tab lists all users currently logged into this computer
	- it shows what they are doing in that particular session
	- you can disconnect the user, log them off, send them a message
	- in 8-10 you have more functionality: detailed process information for each user, performance statistics like CPU, memory, etc.
	- in other words it looks like the Processes tab multiplied by each user including your own
