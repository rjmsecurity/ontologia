# Screen sharing

- in Windows you use Remote Desktop to view the screen of another computer, in macOS it's with screen sharing
- go to Finder > right click a computer on the network > share screen
- you can also use third party utilities that are compatible with VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
- VNC is the screen sharing technology built into macOS
- the Messer video didn't talk about the screenshot of System Preferences he had on the video, showing the Sharing page 

- that's macOS, for Linux there are many options of course and your distro may already come with one
- Ubuntu comes with Remmina Remote Desktop Client
- UltraVNC is another one that you can install and use across any distro
