# Change Management

1. Identify the problem
   - Question the user, identify user changes to computer, perform backups
   - Can you duplicate the issue? 
   - Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
   - Review system and application logs 
2. Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
   - If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms 
3. Test the theory to determine cause
   - Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve problem
   - If theory is not confirmed re-establish new theory or escalate
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution 
5. Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
