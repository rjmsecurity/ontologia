# Proxy settings 

- in an enterprise you find that there are proxies sitting between the user and web servers, e.g. a user doesn't have a direct connection to Google
- Control Panel > Internet Properties > Connections tab
- this has the LAN settings where you can set up your proxy server
- checkmark to say you want to use a proxy server for your LAN with an address and port input fields 
- there's an *Advanced* button besides those fields where you can set up proxies for HTTP, Secure, FTP, and Socks
- also in that advanced page is an exceptions list where you can add IP addresses to not have a proxy on them
- why an IP exceptions list? some proxies tend to break certain applications
