# Link speed and duplex
(part of the *Network card properties* section)

- configuring the properties for the network adapter, aka the network card
- you'll ask what the link speed and duplex is when you're troubleshooting a particular connection
- make sure Windows matches the switch you're connecting to
- same as before, Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings
- but this time when you right click an adapter card and select Properties, select the *Configure* button
- click the Advanced tab and select the Link Speed and Duplex property
- the default is to auto negotiate the speed and duplex but in a scenario where the card and switch can't negotiate...
- you can force a particular speed and duplex e.g. 100 Mbps Half Duplex
