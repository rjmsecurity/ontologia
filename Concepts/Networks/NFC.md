# Near-field communication (NFC)

* NFC builds on RFID which is mostly one-way; extends it into our mobile phones and smartwatches to be able to have two-way conversations with other devices
* wireless transfer of small amounts of data between devices within **4 cm** of each other
* built into many phones and smartwatches, now being integrated into laptops as well 
* used for:
	* payment systems at stores, e.g. Apple Pay uses NFC
	* payment for transportation, e.g. BART subway trains in SF
	* in-person information exchange between mobile devices
	* if you need to pair two Bluetooth devices
	* performing authentication to a device without physically touching
		* the way you use your phone or watch to pay at a store, you can use your phone or watch to authenticate to a laptop 
		* useful at hospital or warehouse if you use a laptop only occasionally and need to quickly authenticate
	* as an access device/token/card that supports encryption and uses NFC; hold it up to a sensor and unlock an electronic door
