# Layer 3 â€“ Network

- aka the *routing layer* because it's associated with IP addresses
- *IP encapsulation* 
- any device that makes forwarding decisions based on IP addresses is communicating at layer 3 
- also the layer where packets are *fragmented*, or broken up, to be able to move between networks
- e.g. from Ethernet to WAN back to Ethernet network

#networkplus **1.1** *Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts.*
