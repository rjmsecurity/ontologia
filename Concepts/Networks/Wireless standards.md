# 802.11 Wireless Standards

Standard | Frequency | Streams
-- | - | - 
802.11a | 5 GHz | N/a
802.11b | 2.4 GHz | N/a
802.11g | 2.4 GHz | N/a
802.11n | 2.4 / 5 GHz | 4 MIMO 
802.11ac | 5 GHz | 8 MU-MIMO 

- [./thoughput.md for their speeds](Bandwidth.md)
- A standard is backwards compatible with another if both are in the same band
	- So 802.11ac is backwards compatible with 802.11a and 802.11n over the 5 GHz band
- The jump from 54 Mbps with 802.11g to 600 Mbps with 802.11n is thanks to MIMO
