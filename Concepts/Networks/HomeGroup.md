# HomeGroup

- HomeGroup no longer exists with Windows 10
- so yeah if you want to set up a homegroup you set it up in the homegroup control panel utility
- if you are setting up a homegroup make sure your network profile is set to "Home"
- you'll be given a shared password that you can put on all the devices part of your homegroup
- what is a homegroup? an extended form of a workgroup, making it easy to share information between systems in the same network
- I don't know why you can't just use shares, which I never even used that before. I am sad all this exists for me to know about. 

from my notes on objective 1.8 (it's the first bullet point for 1.8 btw, then workgroup):
- objective 1.8 aims to ask: How do you connect Windows systems together to share *resources* (files, printers, etc.)?
- designed for the home, for one single private network with trusted computers to share resources
- when you create or join a HomeGroup you can choose whether or not you want to share Pictures, Videos, Music, Documents, Printers & Devices
- configure your network profile to be *Home* and then you can enable HomeGroup, which then gives you a single password for everybody to use (like Mullvad VPN)

#aplus #core2 **1.6** *Given a scenario, use Microsoft Windows Control Panel utilities.*
#aplus #core2 **1.8** *Given a scenario, configure Microsoft Windows networking on a client/desktop.*
