# Printer sharing vs. network printer mapping

- you can share printers across the network just like you can files
- if you have a locally connected printer, go to the printer's Properties > Sharing tab > select *Share this printer*
- to add somebody else's printer, go to Explorer > Add Printer
- from here you can *Add local printer* or *Add network printer*, choose the second one and select from the list of printers
- below the list is *The printer I want isn't listed* where you can type in the name of the network printer
- you can see your new printer in [Devices and Printers](../Systems/Devices%20and%20Printers.md) and print jobs you send will automatically go across the network
