# Layer 2 â€“ Data link

- the foundation for protocols
- for that reason it's also called the DLC (Data Link Control) layer
- because the protocols are called DLC protocols
- an example is MAC addresses on Ethernet, also referred to as layer 2 addresses
- it's ALSO referred to as the switching layer since switches make their forwarding based on MAC address
- e.g. communication happening between 00-21-70-0F-22-5A and 00-21-70-6F-06-F2 is *layer 2 communication*
- data is sent in *frames* but Prof. Messer also uses this term interchangeably for layer 3 and 4
- there's also Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48, EUI-64) which you have to research yourself
- *encapsulation* of the above layer TCP and IP traffic within Ethernet frames
