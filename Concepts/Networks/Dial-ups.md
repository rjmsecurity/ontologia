# Dial-up connections
(part of the 1.8 section on establishing networking connections)

- dial-ups are for sysadmins, not traditional users, for when the primary connection to a remote network is unavailable
- it uses a modem connection to standard phone lines
- [Network and Sharing Center](Network%20and%20Sharing%20Center.md)
- since it's a point-to-point connection you just have to provide a username, password, and the phone number you would dial
- after it's configured you connect and disconnect the same way: the network status icon at the bottom of the screen
