# Hotspots

* commonly mobile phones can be wireless hotspots but Messer provides the example of using your "local coffee shop's hotspot"... didn't know the Wi-Fi at a coffee shop is technically a hotspot
- when there isn't a public access point available
- other devices can connect to your mobile phone over 802.11 which uses your wireless provider's network to access the internet
- so you're extending your phone's 3G/LTE/5G connection to the internet to other devices via 802.11, effectively turning your phone into a personal router
- not all phones support it and some providers may charge extra to enable it or have data costs
