# WorkGroup

- lets you have multiple logical groups of devices on the network (so I guess still just one network?)
- each computer maintains its own user information, it's non-centralized
- in other words a computer's user and password is not shared by any other computers 
- so to change a password you have to change it on every computer associated with this workgroup... I hope they don't test me on workgroups
- Control Panel > System has the settings for your computer name, domain, workgroup
