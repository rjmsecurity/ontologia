# Layer 4 â€“ Transport

- or the *post office layer* because this layer describes how and where data is being delivered 
- protocols are TCP and UDP
- with that are the TCP and UDP port numbers 
- *TCP encapsulation* of the data from the above layers
- e.g. web page is so large that you have to split it into segments or datagrams to be sent across the network 
- e.g. https://gmail.com over port 443

#networkplus **1.1** *Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts.*
