# PDU

- *protocol data unit* or *transmission unit*
- send all your data across a network within one unit
- e.g. Ethernet sends a frame from one MAC addy to another MAC
- IP operates on a packet of data, sending from one IP addy to another 
- Ethernet and IP don't care what's inside the PDU, only about moving it across the network
- e.g. packet contains TCP or UDP data
- speaking of which, TCP has segments and UDP has datagrams

#networkplus **1.1** *Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts.*
