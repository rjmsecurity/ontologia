# Home vs. Work vs. Public network settings 

- Windows recognizes where you are â€“ at home, an airport, etc.
- in Windows 7 there are three network profiles: Home, Work, Public
	- Home, all devices in the network are trusted and are allowed to connect to you
	- Work, you can see other devices but you can't, say, join a HomeGroup
	- Public, you are invisible
- in Windows 8-10 it's been reduced to two profiles: Private and Public
	- Private lets other devices connect and access shares
	- Public does not allow any sharing or connectivity
	- customize a network location by going to settings > Network & Internet > Change connection properties
	- from there choose Public or Private for the network profile and configure firewall and security settings appropriately for your location
