# BIOS
(part of the *Network card properties* section)

- here you can administratively disable NICs
- you have access to all the hardware and can enable/disable devices
- e.g. Advanced > Integrated Devices > Onboard LAN Controller > Disabled > Save > Restart computer
- it varies but if you have this BIOS and did that, Windows wouldn't see any network hardware available on the PC
- if you make these changes, it's common to set an administrator password for the BIOS
- your system boots normally but prevents anyone else from going into BIOS and making changes
