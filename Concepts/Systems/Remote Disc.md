# Remote Disc

- it's becoming less and less common for devices to have a DVD-ROM player inside
- in macOS you can share a DVD-ROM over the network, or use someone else's shared one!
- e.g. you can transfer files from that DVD-ROM to any system on the network
- does not work with audio CDs or video DVDs, it's designed for the transfer of data
- if your computer is the one with the DVD-ROM drive, go to System Preferences > Sharing 
- check or uncheck *DVD or CD Sharing*
- as well as *Ask me before allowing others to use my DVD drive*
- Remote Disc is integrated into the Finder, in the left sidebar
- click it and you'll see all the available remote discs on your network
