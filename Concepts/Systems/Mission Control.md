- you can also Control + Up arrow
- when you move an app to a different desktop, you're moving it to a different *Space*

We'll just add the Gestures bullet points here: 

- you can use from one to four fingers at once! the best trackpad of them all!
- System Preferences > Trackpad
- swipe, pinch, click, tap, dap, bop, chop, drop kick, flying knee!
