# Time Machine

- scheduled backups 
- hourly backups for the past 24 hours
- daily backups for the past month
- weekly backups for all previous months
- oldest backups are deleted when backup disk becomes full

- when you want to restore from a backup, Time Machine brings up a familiar view of the Finder showing a particular folder (that you selected?)
- navigate to a particular backup (which looks like a Finder with different files) by clicking on one of the dates along the right side
- click one button, *Restore*, and you're done

- if you're away from your backup drive, macOS still takes snapshots 
- when you connect back to your network, Time Machine updates the backup with the snapshot information
