- drivers are the intermediary between the OS and hardware because the OS can't directly talk to the hardware connected to the CPU
- drivers are OS- and hardware-specific
- question: *do you have the latest device drivers installed in your operating system?*
- right click on a driver in the list on the left side > update driver | disable device | uninstall device | scan system for hardware changes | properties
- if you select properties > options, you can configure this specific device, see its version and details, change it, update it, delete it
