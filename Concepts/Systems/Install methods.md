# Methods of installation and deployment 

- Local (CD/USB) 
	- local just means the install program and the computer are in the same place
	- one method is to download the executable (the app) over the web
	- CD-ROM/DVD-ROM/other optical media is an alternative method common with third party apps
	- USB is the most compatible with devices and supports large installation programs like the one to install Windows

- Network-based 
	- in corporate environments it's inefficient to go station to station with a CD-ROM so what's common is to have a central server
	- also called a staging server, apps are staged and deployed from it 
	- and if you have an update, you can manage your app from this one location and redeploy to all those computers
