# System Restore

- System Restore takes your Windows configuration and brings it back to a previous one
- remember *restore points*?
- Windows is good about automatically creating restore points when you update the OS or install a new app
- during boot up, press F8 > Advanced Boot Options > Repair
- or Ctrl Panel > Recovery
- note that malware is capable of infecting your current system and all restore points
- so this utility is great for non-malware issues where you just want to take your system back to a known good restore point
