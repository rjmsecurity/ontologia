# `defrag`

- `defrag` (Disk Defragmenter) makes files contiguous instead of split across the drive's sectors
- improves read and write time
- it's for disk drives, not SSDs
- the graphical interface is found by right clicking a drive > Properties > Tools > *Optimize and defragment drive*
- `defrag C:` for example
- requires elevated permissions
- it's scheduled to run weekly with newer Windows so you don't need to manually

#aplus #core2 **1.5** *Given a scenario, use Microsoft operating system features and tools.*
