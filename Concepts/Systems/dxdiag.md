# `dxdiag` (DirectX Diagnostic Tool)

- DirectX is an API that developers use to create apps that deal with multimedia or graphics on Windows
- if you're troubleshooting a problem with one of these apps, you may want to check how DirectX is being used on your Windows
- view how DirectX is used for your display, sound, input
- also a good generic diagnostic tool, not just for DirectX, so if you have graphics or sound issues, run some of the tests in dxdiag
- you're checking if what you expect to see for the graphics and sound on this computer are the same as what DirectX sees and therefore the apps that use DirectX
