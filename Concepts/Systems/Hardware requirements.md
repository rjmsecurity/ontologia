# Windows hardware requirements

* **CPU ⟹** 1 GHz processor or faster
* **Free disk space ⟹** 32 GB or larger
* **Video ⟹** Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver, minimum of 800 x 600

There are actually two pieces of literature saying different things about Windows 10:

The previous CompTIA A+ 1002 lists different CPU and disk requirements for Windows 7-10:

- **Free disk space ⟹** 16 GB for x86 and 20 GB for x64
- **Windows 7 ⟹** 1 GHz processor
- **Windows 8-10 ⟹** 1 GHz processor with support for PAE **¹**, NX processor bit to protect against malicious software, SSE2
**¹** PAE (physical address extension) lets 32-bit processors use more than 4 GB of memory
