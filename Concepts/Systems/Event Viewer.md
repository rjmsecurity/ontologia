# Event Viewer
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- view all the *events* happening in Windows with or without you knowing: application, security, setup, and system events
- each event is further categorized as information, warning, error, critical, successful audit, or failure audit
- in the utility on the main pane you can see a summary of administrative events
- e.g. 1 critical event in the last 7 days
- on the left you can Windows Logs > System (logs) > select a log to view the details for that particular log
- you will see the level of each log, date and time, source, category
- e.g. message for a particular error log: The app specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID Windows.SecurityCenter.SecurityAppBroker
- so if you're troubleshooting a problem with an app or the OS you may be able to find the root cause of it in the event viewer
