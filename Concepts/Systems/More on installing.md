* if the install program doesn't recognize a piece of hardware and doesn't load the appropriate driver
* you need to provide the drivers during or after install ("load alternate third-party drivers when necessary")
- e.g. the OS doesn't recognize the controller that the storage device is plugged into so you provide additional drivers so the install program can properly access those storage drives

- if you have the option to upgrade and keep files in place instead of starting fresh with an install, Windows installer will ask you what you want to do
