# mmc
(mmc is part of the *administrative* tools and *system utilities* categories)

- Microsoft Management Console => `mmc.exe`
- `mmc` or `mmc.exe` is if you're doing a lot of sysadmin and you want your own management console
- starts as a blank slate to which you add predefined plugins and utilities, or *snap-ins*, that you need to do your job
- snap-ins such as event viewer, shared folders, local users and groups, perfmon
- File > Add Snap-in > Computer Management > Add 
- from here you can select the computer you want this snap-in to apply to, whether local or for someone else on the network
- repeat adding snap-ins you want and then click OK, now your snap-ins are found in the sidebar with the selected one viewed on the right side
- Computer Management is not just a snap-in but what the entire mmc itself is also known as
- File > Save As > Console1 on Desktop will save the current customized *console* to the desktop so you can have a console for each task you have
- most of the below tools you can add as a snap-in and access them that way
