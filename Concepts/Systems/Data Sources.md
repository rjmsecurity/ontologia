# Data Sources
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- Data Sources (ODBC Data Source Administrator utility)
- many apps read and write to a database
- in order to separate the app from the database engine running on the OS, there's ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
- ODBC allows the app developer to write their app without any concern for the type of db running on the backend
- the app developer focuses on the app functionality; the end user can decide what type of db runs on their OS
- as an admin you can configure this connection in Control Panel > Administrative Tools 
- users probably won't need this
- under the Drivers tab you can see listed all the different data sources available for applications
- examples include Access db, Excel spreadsheet, Oracle, Microsoft SQL
- if there's a db you need to add for an app to be able to access it, this utility is where you go
