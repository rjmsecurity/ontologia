# Boot methods

- *optical discs* such as CD-ROM, DVD, or Blu-ray are common media
- USB flash drive or external eSATA drive 
	- contains OS files
	- must be bootable
	- computer must support booting from USB
	- hot swappable
	- so if you have many OS installation files to store, use external media and connect via USB
	- some even allow to configure parts of the drive as an ISO image which makes it look like a DVD-ROM or CD-ROM image to the computer
- *PXE* (Preboot eXecution Environment) or "Pixie" is a network boot, meaning you perform a remote network installation
	- the computer must support it
- *NetBoot* is Apple's version of PXE to install macOS across a network
- *internal fixed disks* such as HDDs and SSDs if you want to store many OS installation files
- *internal hard drive partition* where you have two separate partitions on the same physical drive, one to boot from, another to install the OS into
