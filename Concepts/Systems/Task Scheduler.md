# Task Scheduler
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- Task Scheduler lets you schedule an app or batch file to run at particular times of the day
- you can use predefined *schedules*, as they're called, or add your own
- organize schedules with folders
- Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Task Scheduler
- e.g. Task Scheduler library in left sidebar > Microsoft > Windows > many different categories
- on the right is the main screen where you see *active tasks* which are enabled and not expired
- so if you click Defrag in the categories, the main screen will show:
	- how the task runs in General
	- what makes the task run in Triggers
	- what exactly happens in Actions
	- conditions to make the task stop in Conditions, e.g. Defrag only if on AC power, stop if on batter
- on the very far right side is Actions where you create your own tasks as mentioned above
- Actions > Create Task > General | Triggers | etc. and configure it to run exactly what/when/how you want
