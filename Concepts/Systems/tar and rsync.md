# `tar` and `rsync`

- an advantage of Linux is you can perform a task in many ways and in the way that's best for you
- `tar` (Tape Archive) is one way to backup and restore
- even though tape is in the name, it works with any storage device
- easy to script into a backup schedule, right from the command line

- `rsync` (Remote Sync) is another common utility, designed to synchronize data between devices
- can configure to copy information instantly between devices or schedule it to occur at a particular time of the day

- these utilities are built into most distros, along with some kind of graphical utility 
- Ubuntu has a Backups utility where you have *Back Up Now*, *Restore*, and *Scheduling*
- check the documentation for your distro to see what options are available 

#aplus #core2 **1.9** *Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.*
