# App Store

- all updates for both applications and macOS are centralized into this one utility
- this process is automatic but you can set it to be manual
- you'd go to the Updates section and see for yourself if there are any updates and click the update buttons yourself
- again, this is also where patch management takes place as you install new macOS versions
- you can see previous updates here too for apps and macOS 

#aplus #core2 **1.9** *Given a scenario, use features and tools of the Mac OS and Linux client/desktop operating systems.*
