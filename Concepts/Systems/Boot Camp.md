# Boot Camp

- dual-boot into Windows on Mac hardware
- e.g. if you have an app that runs exclusively in Windows, like, I don't know, Call of Duty 
- since the underlying architecture is based on Intel, similar to Windows (so is there Boot Camp on M1 Macs?)
- you do need specialized device drivers that understand the Apple hardware
- Boot Camp builds out the partition for Windows and ensures you have the correct device drivers
