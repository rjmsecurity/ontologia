# `su` and `sudo`

- some commands need elevated rights 
- `su` switches user and you can switch to a super user (like an Administrator in Windows) to run commands with elevated rights until you `exit` 
- `su` without any arguments assumes you want to switch to root
- `sudo` lets you execute a command as the super user or a different user ID
- Messer says only that command executes as the super user but isn't there `sudo` mode?
