# `apt-get` and `yum`

- you want to be running the latest software for your OS
- `apt-get` or `yum` for system updates, depending on your distro
- with graphical distros you may find a Software Updater – a graphical update manager
- these updates can be scheduled, if you're doing patch management or you have change control requirements
- you may also have a Software Center where you can see your installed apps and install new ones

also since there's just a couple bullet points on driver and firmware updates in Linux: 

- many drivers are integrated with the kernel, so when you update the kernel, you update the drivers
- in some cases you need to install your own device driver, many distros include a graphical frontend to make that process easier
- e.g. the screenshot shows Ubuntu's Software & Updates > Additional Drivers tab
- you can also install those drivers from the command line
