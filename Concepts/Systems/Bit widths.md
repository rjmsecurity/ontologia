# 32-bit and 64-bit

- these terms apply to processors, operating systems, apps and drivers because they need to be compatible with each other
- 4 GB of memory is the limit for 32-bit processors 
- 17 billion GB is the theoretical limit for 64-bit processors
- a 32-bit operating system cannot run 64-bit apps
- *x64* means 64-bit
- *x86* means 32-bit (because back then it was just 32-bit OSes running on Intel 8086, 286, 386, 486...)
- if you want to upgrade from 32-bit Windows to 64-bit or vice versa, you have to go through a [clean install](Types%20of%20installations.md)
