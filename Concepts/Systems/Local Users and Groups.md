# Local Users and Groups
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- Local Users and Groups is a utility to manage users 
- Administrator is the super user
- Guest users have limited access, if enabled that is
- "regular" users run applications, print, etc.
- *groups* are logical collections of users sharing common set of rights and permissions
- adding to a group assigns particular permissions, removing from group revokes them
- so you can simply manage a group instead of each individual user
