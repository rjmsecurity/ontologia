# Devices and Printers

- *Devices and Printers* provides a summary of all the devices your computer can see on the network
- it's more categorized than Device Manager (`devmgmt.msc`): you have Devices, you have Multimedia Devices, and you have Printers
- also what Device Manager can't do that this can is show devices across the network... wait what's the difference between across and on the network
- right click a device and view its properties and make changes to it
