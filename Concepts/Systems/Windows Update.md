# Windows Update

- Windows Update is the way you get automatic OS updates
- you can configure it to download the files and wait for you to install the update
- or to check but don't download the files, good if you have limited bandwidth
- or fourth and finally, never check for updates, which you should never choose
- in Windows 10 you can also specify when to schedule a restart and change the *active hours* so the update only takes effect when your system is not in use
