# Component Services
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- Microsoft COM+ (Component Object Model) is a model that helps developers build apps for Windows
- you'll see this in the enterprise where app developers create object oriented apps for an organization
- if you're deploying these apps you may need to use Component Services to see how the app is configured in the OS
- plus you can view Event Viewer and Services so you get a total view of everything that's happening with that app
- on left you have listed component services for your computer or others on the network
- e.g. local computer shows COM+ applications, DCOM configuration, running processes, Distributed Transaction Coordinator
- so just know you go here if there are any configurations that need to be made on a computer to be able to run these applications
