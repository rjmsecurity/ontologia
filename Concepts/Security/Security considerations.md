# Security considerations 

- make sure you know exactly where an application comes from before you install it and that you have security procedures in place to prevent the following:
- Impact to device 
	- since running apps have the same permissions as the user, they can cause slowdowns, delete files, and more
- Impact to network
	- malicious programs can go beyond that and travel across the network, access internal services and file shares it has permissions to access, and cause damage there
