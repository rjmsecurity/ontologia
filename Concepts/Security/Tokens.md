# Tokens

- token-based access means you need a device to provice a token/certificate to gain access to a resource

- smart cards are one way and can be integrated with an ID card, insert into laptop or door and you're in
- a smart card looks different from an RFID chip card I guess because the smart card has an actual gold looking chip on the front of it
- often combined with a PIN to achieve MFA â€“ you possess the card and know the PIN

- USB token is another way where the certificate is on the USB and you just insert the USB

- a *hardware token* is a device that generates a pseudo-random authentication code
- a software token is the same thing in the form of an app on your phone

- your phone is a device too that can receive a code via SMS
