# Other physical measures

- cable locks are useful when you're mobile
- they're thin and can be cut so they are not long-term solutions

- you may be in charge of a group of cabinets in a data center
- the cabinets have locks, server locks

- USB locks are inserted with a special insertion key into a USB interface and can only be removed with that tool
- again, it's not enough to have just a USB lock or a BIOS software lock on the USB interface so you use both, this is called *defense in depth*

- privacy filters are helpful for mobile users in public places
- narrow angle of view, somebody could be sitting next to you and see nothing
- sit with your back to the wall
