# Antivirus/Anti-malware 

- unlike Windows, macOS does not include it
- many 3rd-party options from the usual companies
- there are far fewer threats to macOS; it's all about the number of desktops
- but you still need to protect your macOS
- once your antivirus and anti-malware is installed, automate your signature updates
- it's common to set it up to be hourly or daily so you're sure you're getting the latest signatures to protect against all of the emerging threats

- same for Linux, although I saw John Hammond last year demo how pkexec can gain root a Linux distro so 
- a common third-party app for Linux is ClamAV, an open source antivirus engine
- also in addition to keeping your signature database updated, always use real-time virus scanning 
- that way you'll know instantly if a malware or virus is identified by your virus engine
