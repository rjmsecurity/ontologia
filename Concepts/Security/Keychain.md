# Keychain

- a centralized password management utility
- passwords you save on website, browser certificates, and other important information
- it's integrated into macOS so any running apps can take advantage of it
- everything in it is encrypted with 3DES ("triple dehs")
- by default macOS uses your login password to encrypt your keychain
