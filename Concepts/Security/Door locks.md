# Door locks

- the conventional way to lock and unlock a door is with a lock and key, or with a deadbolt

- electronic locks are keyless and use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) or are token-based with an RFID badge, magnetic swipe card, or key fob
- RFID card has a little black chip near the middle and an antenna wrapping around the card (copper wire) to passively receive power and send information 
- key fobs use a similar tech and just look like an accessory for your key ring

- biometric readers are also used to unlock, reading your retina, hand, or fingerprint
- they store a mathematical representation of your fingerprint, not a picture, and compare using an algorithm

- biometric information is always tied to one person and difficult to change but it's not foolproof, so you'll see it used in conjunction with PIN or other method
- another MFA example is using both a smart card and a PIN
