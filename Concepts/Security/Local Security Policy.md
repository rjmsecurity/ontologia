# Local Security Policy
(part of the *administrative* tools category)

- local policies are the counterpart to Active Directory
- Active Directory lets you manage tens, hundreds, or thousands of computers
- you assign Group Policies that affect many computers at once
- but at home, standalone computers aren't managed through AD but through local policies
- it's only available with Pro, Ultimate, and Enterprise
- the utility app is separated into categories: account policies, local policies, windows defender firewall policies, etc. 
- account > password > maximum password age | minimum password length | reversible encryption or not
- this is called granular control
