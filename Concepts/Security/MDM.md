# MDM (Mobile Device Management)

- phones are becoming more common devices to access company data
- companies need to protect their data

- MDM is how companies manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices (aka BYOD, Bring Your Own Device)
- policies can be set on apps, data, camera, etc. 
- e.g. while you're at work, you cannot access your phone's camera until you leave the facility

- sometimes the company controls the entire device, not just their data but yours too
- more modern MDM creates a partition to separate the company's data from your data

- access control can also be managed
- e.g. require everybody have a lock screen and password
