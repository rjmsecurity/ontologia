# Entrance security

- a man trap or *access control vestibule* is common in data centers 
- that small area between two doors, allowing only one person or a small, controlled group to go through
- either both doors are unlocked but opening one causes the other to lock, or both are locked and unlocking one prevents the other from being unlocked

- you may have a person such as a security guard process you or your group while you're in the man trap – checking IDs, checking equipment
- security guards are responsible for protecting the physical area and making sure only employees are entering

- guests check in at the security guard station to get access to the building 
- the guard keeps an *entry control roster*, or access list

- ID badges have your picture, name, employment details and must be worn at all times
- guests are given a guest ID badge
