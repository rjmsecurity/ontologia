# Certificates

- much more difficult to circumvent having to have a particular object
- some laptops have smart card readers
- usually smart cards have a digital certificate so that the smart card can be cryptographically tied to a particular individual
- commonly used with MFA e.g. alongside a PIN or fingerprint

- US Federal Government uses a smart card called a PIV card (Personal Identity Verification)
- DoD uses a CAC (Common Access Card)

- it's all about managing a certificate 
- some orgs take the cert and put it on the local storage drive of a laptop instead, or on a USB key
- this is commonly done with 802.1x authentication
