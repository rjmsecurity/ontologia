## CompTIA A+ 1001 and 1002

Resource | Description
-- | -
1500-page book by Mike Meyers (~$40) <br><br>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1260454037<br><br>[Preorder the new edition for the 1101 and 1102](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Certification-Eleventh-220-1101-220-1102-dp-1264609906/dp/1264609906) | When it comes to things I care about like privilege escalation methods, I will go through a series of blog posts until I grasp the concept. <br><br>But when it comes to the inside of an LCD display or toner cartridge mechanics, which this book will teach you everything about, reading is gruesome. <br><br>That being said, eat the frog first as Mark Twain said. Nothing beats pen and paper as a first resource. <br><br>Rote memorization isn't replaced by hands-on practice, it's supplemented by it. And if you're going to power through a whole ton of information, do it in multiple formats...
Professor Messer's playlists<br><br>[1001](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlGHY8ObL8DiyP3AIu9vd3K) and [1002](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnmwkCAdWUgCFvVK4IxMBTmb)<br><br>[1101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) and [1102 (coming soon)](https://www.youtube.com/c/professormesser/playlists) | ...And that's where Messer comes in. The book could have used more images. Messer shows you video of what a RAM replacement looks like, for example. <br><br>After you've read a dozen paragraphs describing what it's like. <br><br>And the videos hammer home points you may have missed in the book. 
The official CompTIA A+ exam objectives<br><br>[1001](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-a-220-1001-exam-objectives.pdf) and [1002](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-a-220-1002-exam-objectives.pdf)<br><br>[1101](https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-a-220-1101-exam-objectives-(3-0)) and [1102](https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-a-220-1102-exam-objectives-(3-0)) | While watching the Messer videos, I went through the objectives for the first time and recognized everything in this document is word for word in the video series. <br><br>So this document is Professor Messer's script and to me it's a transcript. <br><br>The way the videos sealed in the information from the book, the objectives sealed in the information from the videos. <br><br>I turned the objectives into an outline, writing notes as I was watching the videos. But the notes are incomplete because I started them halfway through. <br><br>And because I was cramming I also powered through the second half of the 1002 playlist without taking notes. 12 hours before the 1002 exam. 
[Thanh Hung's free iPhone app with practice questions](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comptia-a-exam-training/id1501304886) | Now that we rote memorized (kind of), we get hands on.<br><br>I mean, you could have installed a virtual machine and typed in the command line while you were watching Messer, but did you? 
[totalsem.com](https://totalsem.com) | The book had a link to a free practice test for both the 1001 and 1002 on this website. <br><br>And that's it! These last two resources are what I went through twice the final hours before the 1002, effectively turning hands-on back into rote memorization. <br><br>If I was more disciplined I would have also gone through the Udemy courses by Mike Meyers and Jason Dion that I bought. Meyers is funny.
